    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a tuna casserole that even my picky family loves! The potato chips give the casserole a crunchy crust.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen green peas</li>
        <li>½ (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup crushed potato chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until
            tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix noodles, condensed soup, 1 cup cheese, tuna, peas, mushrooms, and onion in a large bowl until well
            combined. Transfer into a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with crushed potato chip and remaining 1 cup of cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
