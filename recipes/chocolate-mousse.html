    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I make this recipe for the holidays. It is the only pie that is gone at the end of the night. I use high-quality
        chocolate chips; they are easier to melt. You can use milk or semi sweet chips. You can use any ready made or
        cooked pie crust.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>21 chocolate sandwich cookies, crushed</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream, chilled</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9 inch springform pan with 2 3/4 inch
            sides.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together crushed cookies and softened butter or margarine. Press mixture evenly into
            greased pan. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes, then allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 cup cream, chocolate, vanilla extract, and salt, in the top of a double boiler. Heat until
            chocolate is fully melted and mixture is smooth. Alternatively, if you have a food processor, you can blend
            mixture by placing chocolate, vanilla extract, and salt, in processor bowl. Bring 1 cup cream to a boil on
            stovetop, then slowly pour cream into processor with blade running. Continue to process until mixture is
            smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Pour chocolate mixture into a bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat 2 cups chilled cream with 1/4 cup sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form. Fold whipped
            cream into chocolate mixture. Pour mixture into cooled crust.</li>
        <li>Chill pie at least 6 hours before serving. Prior to serving, beat remaining 1 cup cream with 1/4 cup sugar.
            Beat until stiff, then pipe onto top of pie with a star tip, or place a spoonful on top of each slice.</li>
    </ol>
